# Welcome to Project Battleships!
This is a simple console application for the battleships game designed for a highschool computer science class with the intention of learning:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data structures such as arrays and arraylists
- Proper coding practices
- How to play battleships!

Goals:
- Clear up commented code
- Remove redundant methods and code that brings up unwanted result
- Properly document the code

Maybe you'll see these changes take place in the near future! Who knows! If you'd like to, feel free to make a copy of my work and edit it as you please.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
